This project deals with the development of a model that can help prevent and treat diseases caused by micro-organisms. Using Clustering techniques optimized with genetic algorithms, it is expected to find an effective model about the available databases. With the data from Brazilian Ministry of Health about micro-organisms' resistance to  antibiotics in different people - different ages, gender and region that inhabits - is expected to find implicit information that can solve the initial problem. To be able to develop the project the basic concepts were studied, gathering the key techniques and the development of a first model that will be used on the data.
